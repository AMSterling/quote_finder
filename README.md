# Quote Finder

### Instructions

Using the Quotable API, add functionality to search for quotes by a particular keyword, and display results on a new page. 

### Versions

Rails 5.2.8

Ruby 2.7.2

### Setup

- Clone this repo
- `bundle install`
- `rails db:{create,migrate}`
- `rails s`

When you visit localhost, you should see a landing page with a form to search by keyword. The button to search by keyword will not work right away, and that is functionality that you'll be building out.
